A written summary of the candidate's work from these coding challenges
must be submitted to Paylocity at least 24 hours prior to the
candidate's interview.

## Problem 1 of 2: Writing a *Python* program to manage records in a *PostgreSQL* database

Each candidate is required to complete the following exercise and return
it a minimum of 24 hours before their interview. They will be asked to
share their ideas with the team during the interview. They should be
prepared to walk the team through concepts such as the following.

1.  “*Here is a summary of the work that I performed.*”

2.  “*How did I accomplish the task?*”

3.  “*Why did I choose a particular approach?*”

Also be prepared for a few questions from the team such as, “*What would
you do if ‘this issue’ came up?*”

The team wants to get an idea how the person thinks. Also, the
submitted/developed code should run.

The expectation is that the candidate will complete the `Python`
exercise ahead of time and walk through their answer during the
**Technical Interview**. The candidate will be expected to present their
code and show it running on their machine.

## Problem 2 of 2: Multi-part SQL Exercise: Live walk-through

The following figure shows an *entity relationship diagram* (ERD) for a
conceptual data model containing the following four tables, which are
are part of a generic data model for managing a company’s HR functions.

1.  Company

2.  Position

3.  Employee

</figure>

<div style="clear: both;">

The expectation is that the candidate is able to write SQL live while
using whatever tool to which they have access, as well as asking
questions of the team. For our data needs, we will be either retrieving
or inserting additional data into our physical database schema that is
based on the data model described here. All of the following actions
will be performed on the physical database schema.

</div>

**ACTIONS**

-   INSERT

-   UPDATE

-   DELETE

A `timestamp` will be inserted or updated with various records in each
of the tables in our database.
